# Interactive Supermarket Map of the Czech Republic

This project generates an interactive map of the Czech Republic, highlighting cities with Lidl, Kaufland, and Tesco supermarkets based on user-provided data.

## Project Structure

- `create_enhanced_map.py`: The main Python script to generate the map. It reads city data, geocodes the cities, and creates the HTML map file.
- `user_city_data.json`: A JSON file containing the list of cities and the presence of Lidl, Kaufland, or Tesco supermarkets. This file is the primary data source for the map.
- `czech_republic_city_supermarket_map.html`: The output interactive map file generated by the script.
- `cities_with_supermarkets.txt`: A simple text file listing all cities from the user-provided data. (Note: This file is not directly used by the map generation script).
- Other `.py` files: Legacy scripts for fetching data from OpenStreetMap, which are not used by the current map generation process.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `folium`
- `geopy`

## Setup and Local Launch

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soleqs/Czech_markets_map.git
   cd Czech_markets_map
   ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install folium geopy
   ```

3. **Run the script to generate the map:**
   ```bash
   python create_enhanced_map.py
   ```
   This will create or update the `czech_republic_city_supermarket_map.html` file.

4. **View the map:**
   Open the `czech_republic_city_supermarket_map.html` file in your web browser to see the interactive map.

## How to Update the City List

To add, remove, or modify cities and their supermarket data, edit the `user_city_data.json` file. Follow the existing JSON structure:

```json
[
    {
        "city": "City Name",
        "Lidl": true,
        "Kaufland": false,
        "Tesco": true
    }
]
```

After editing the file, run the `create_enhanced_map.py` script again to regenerate the map with your changes.

## Deployment to Netlify

Since this project generates a static HTML file, you can easily deploy it on Netlify.

1.  After running the script and generating the `czech_republic_city_supermarket_map.html` file, push your changes to your Git repository.
2.  **Create a new site on Netlify:**
    - Log in to your Netlify account.
    - Click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project".
    - Connect to your Git provider (e.g., GitHub).
    - Select the repository for this project.
    - In the deployment settings, ensure that:
        - **Build command:** Leave this empty.
        - **Publish directory:** Set to `/` (the root of the project).
    - Click "Deploy site".

Netlify will deploy your `czech_republic_city_supermarket_map.html` and provide a URL to view it.
